**Open Payments** is an open-source initiative dedicated to building the essential components for a modern payment processing engine for banks and financial institutions. Our goal is to provide tools that help simplify financial messaging, enhance interoperability, and promote innovation in the payment industry.

## What We Offer

- **Messages Library**: A comprehensive library that supports parsing, validating, transforming, and generating financial messages. Currently, the library supports formats like ISO 20022 and FedNow.
  
- **Sample Data Generation**: Automatically generate valid sample messages for testing and development purposes.

- **Orchestration Engine** (Coming Soon): Seamlessly manage the flow of payment transactions across different systems and services.

- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to be modular and open, making it easy to integrate with existing systems or extend functionality as needed.
